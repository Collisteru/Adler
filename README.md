# Feature Implementation Plan:

* Begin with Tkinter GUI. Create a space for displaying books and make sure that it can display an infinitely long list of books -- DONE
* Next, make this list tied to a file in the same folder -- DONE
* Next, make functions for adding and taking away books from the list -- DONE
* Add tagging functionality -- DONE
* Add a way to edit a book: its title, tags, rating, etc.
* Add searching by tag
* You already have a good product right there.
