# Adler
A local reading material management tool


# Features

* Maintain a tagged list of books you want to read
* Keep currently-reading books in a docker
* Add comments on a certain book, and a place to put what you'ver read at the end, along with reviews for it
* Add a CSV file of articles (Wikipedia, Britannica, Blog articles, Other things), then have the software present you with one article a day until they are all done

** Break the articles into chunks based on text?

# Feature Implementation Plan:

* Begin with Tkinter GUI. Create a space for displaying books and make sure that it can disaplay an infinitely long list of books
* Next, make this list tied to a file in the same folder
* Next, make functions for adding and taking away books from the list
* Add tagging functionality
* Add searching by tag
* You already have a good product right there.
